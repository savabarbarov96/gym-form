- [ ] Test all payment flows in a staging environment

## ðŸ“‹ Final Production Deployment Steps

1. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to production server**
   - Upload the build files to your web hosting
   - If using a CI/CD pipeline, trigger the deployment

3. **Verify production deployment**
   - Test the checkout flow with a real card
   - Verify webhooks are being triggered
   - Check Stripe Dashboard for successful payments
   - Validate that users receive their plans via email

4. **Monitoring and Support**
   - Set up error monitoring
   - Create a system to track and respond to customer support requests
   - Monitor Stripe events for payment failures

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

- [ ] Ensure HTTPS is enabled for all production URLs
- [ ] Verify Stripe public keys are properly restricted

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Payments are successful but webhooks aren't triggering
- Check Stripe webhook configuration in the Stripe Dashboard
- Verify webhook endpoints are accessible from the internet
- Look for webhook errors in the Stripe Dashboard

### Users aren't receiving their plans after payment
- Check webhook logs to ensure the webhooks are being triggered
- Verify that the email system at automationaid.eu is functioning properly
- Ensure form data is being properly submitted in the webhook payload

### Payment flow is interrupted or returns errors
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify all Stripe keys are valid and not expired
- Check Stripe Dashboard for any account restrictions or limitations
