# Body Type Images

This directory contains images used for the body type selection page.

## How to Replace with Stock Photos

For the best visual effect, replace these placeholder files with copyright-free stock images of each body type:

1. `ectomorph.jpg` - Use an image of a person with a slim body type (ectomorph)
2. `mesomorph.jpg` - Use an image of a person with an athletic body type (mesomorph)
3. `endomorph.jpg` - Use an image of a person with a heavier body type (endomorph)

### Recommended Image Specifications:
- Size: 800x1200px or similar portrait aspect ratio
- Content: Full body shots of people with the respective body types
- Format: JPG or PNG
- License: Make sure to use copyright-free images (e.g., from Unsplash, Pexels, etc.)

### Image Effect
The images will be displayed with:
- A dark overlay gradient
- The SVG illustration overlay
- A text label at the bottom

This provides a consistent look while still showing the different body types.
